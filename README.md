# NXT Enhanced

My Personal fork of John Hansen's NXT Enhanced Firmware. Mostly for playing with at this point, because I have a
Mindstorms NXT that I have not used in a while.

## Current Goals

- Get ATMEGA48 compiling with Atmel Studio.
  - I know that Atmel Studio is probably EOL soon, but it has GCC built in, and I want to stick with open source
    frameworks, instead of Microchip's XC8 that MPLABX forces on us now.
- Get ARM compiling with Segger Embedded Studio using GCC as compiler.
  - Segger Embedded Studio is not FOSS, but GCC is, so it should be fairly easy to break away from Segger if need be.
    Besides, Segger Emebedded Studio is free for hobbyist use.
